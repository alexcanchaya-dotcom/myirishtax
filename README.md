## Running locally
1. Install Node.js 18+.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (requires internet access to npm registry).
3. Build minified assets: `node scripts/build.js`.
4. Start server: `npm start` then open `http://localhost:3000`.

> Note: In offline or restricted environments, `npm install` may fail. When available, allow outbound access to `registry.npmjs.org`.

### Environment variables
- `PORT` (default `3000`)
- `SUPPORT_EMAIL` – destination inbox for contact form
- `FROM_EMAIL` – sender email
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` – SMTP credentials for Nodemailer
- `ENABLE_SSL` – set to `true` to indicate SSL health in `/health`

## API routes
- `POST /api/contact` – sends enquiry email (expects `name`, `email`, `message`, `consent`)
- `POST /api/onboarding` – creates onboarding record and schedules reminder
- `POST /api/upload` – accepts single file upload (ready for S3 wiring)
- `POST /api/reminders` – schedules reminder emails
- `POST /api/upsell` – creates upsell intent scaffolding
- `GET /health` – basic status + SSL flag

## Automation stubs
`src/automations/workflows.js` stores records in-memory but is structured for:
- User onboarding flow (email + filing type)
- Secure document upload (replace with S3/Blob storage API)
- Reminder scheduling (hook to cron/queue provider)
- Upsell intents (e.g., tax residency assessment, PAYE refund estimator, income categorizer)

## Compliance and trust
- Google Ads–ready legal pages: Privacy, Terms, Cookies, Refunds, About
- Cookie consent banner with accept/reject paths
- Business identity surfaced in the footer (CRO, address, contact details)
- SEO metadata and Schema.org (LocalBusiness, FAQ)

## Deployment
- Serve `/public` as static assets behind HTTPS.
- Run `node src/backend/server.js` (or containerize) to handle forms/uploads; configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Cloudflare) with SSL.
- Point Google Tag Manager/Analytics, Stripe, and CRM/Airtable credentials via environment variables when integrating.

## Optional enhancements
- Wire `/api/upload` to S3 with server-side encryption and signed URLs.
- Replace in-memory automation store with a database or Airtable/CRM connector.
- Add GA4 + GTM with consent mode in `public/index.html`.
- Activate Stripe Checkout/Payment Links for paid services.
- Add PDF generation for summaries and onboarding confirmation.
