            <div class="faq">
                <h3>What is Class S PRSI for contractors?</h3>
                <p>Class S PRSI is the self-employed PRSI class in Ireland. You pay 4% on income over €5,000. Unlike employees, Class S doesn't provide unemployment benefits but does count towards State Pension.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h3>When is preliminary tax due?</h3>
                <p>Preliminary tax for self-employed contractors is due by October 31st each year. You must pay either 90% of the current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's tax (whichever is lower).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Do contractors get the PAYE tax credit?</h3>
                <p>No, self-employed contractors only receive the Personal Tax Credit (€1,875 in 2024), not the PAYE tax credit. This is one difference between employed and self-employed taxation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h3>What's the difference between income tax and USC?</h3>
                <p>Income tax is calculated on profits (income minus expenses), while USC is calculated on gross income before expenses. USC has 4 bands with rates from 0.5% to 8%.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <h3>Can I claim pension contributions?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Self-employed individuals can claim tax relief on pension contributions. The relief is applied at your marginal tax rate (20% or 40%).</p>
