      <h1>Cookie Notice</h1>
      <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to operate our website, measure performance, and (with your permission) run analytics or marketing tags. Consent is requested via the cookie banner and logged locally with a timestamp.</p>

      <h2>Types of cookies and trackers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential</strong>: required for security, rate limiting, and calculator functionality. These always remain active.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: optional; helps us understand usage trends. Providers include Plausible and Google Analytics 4 when enabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance</strong>: optional Web Vitals and uptime measurements to keep the site reliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing</strong>: optional sponsorship pixels or campaign tracking when we run ads.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Managing cookies</h2>
      <p>You can accept, reject, or customise cookies using the banner, or by clicking “Cookie settings” in the footer or feedback form. Preferences are stored locally so you can evidence consent and change it anytime.</p>

      <h2>Third parties</h2>
      <p>Analytics and marketing tags only load after you opt in. Data is anonymised where possible (for example, IP anonymisation for GA4) and retained according to provider policies. No data is sold.</p>
