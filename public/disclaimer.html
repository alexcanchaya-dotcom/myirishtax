      <h1>Non-advice notice</h1>
      <p>My Irish Tax provides calculators and explainers for informational purposes only. They are not a substitute for professional tax advice tailored to your circumstances.</p>

      <h2>Key points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Figures are estimates based on user inputs and common rate bands; they may not reflect your actual liability.</li>
        <li>No client relationship is created by using the website, calculator, or contact forms until we confirm acceptance in writing.</li>
        <li>Decisions on filing, payroll, advertising, or investment should be made with a qualified advisor who knows your situation.</li>
        <li>External links and sources are provided for convenience and may change; always verify directly with Revenue or other authorities.</li>
