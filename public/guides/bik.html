      <h1>Benefit-in-kind (BIK)</h1>
      <p>BIK adds the value of certain employer-provided benefits to your taxable income. Use this guide to understand common items and how to reflect them in estimates.</p>

      <h2 id="bik-common">Common taxable benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Company cars: taxable value depends on CO₂ emissions, original market value, and business mileage.</li>
        <li>Health insurance: employer-paid premiums are usually a taxable benefit.</li>
        <li>Housing and other perks: accommodation, vouchers above small benefit limits, and some loans can attract BIK.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="bik-how">How to estimate BIK</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the benefit type and confirm if exemptions apply (e.g., small benefit scheme).</li>
        <li>Calculate the taxable value using the Revenue formula for that benefit.</li>
        <li>Add the taxable value to your income and rerun your PAYE/USC/PRSI estimate.</li>
        <li>Store evidence for mileage logs, valuation, or invoices in case of queries.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <div class="faq">

        <p><strong>Do bike-to-work benefits attract BIK?</strong> Approved cycle-to-work schemes are usually exempt up to the statutory limit.</p>
        <p><strong>When is BIK reported?</strong> Employers generally report through payroll on a real-time basis; self-corrections may be needed for understatements.</p>
