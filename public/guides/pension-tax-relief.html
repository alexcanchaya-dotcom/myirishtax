      <h1>Pension tax relief</h1>
      <p>Revenue allows relief on qualifying pension contributions subject to age-related limits and an earnings cap. Use this guide to sense-check contributions before filing.</p>

      <h2 id="pension-limits">Common limits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Relievable contributions are capped by a percentage of earnings that increases with age.</li>
        <li>An overall earnings cap applies; contributions above the cap do not attract tax relief.</li>
        <li>Employer contributions can have separate treatment for benefit-in-kind; check plan rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="pension-how">How to apply relief</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Confirm your age band and the corresponding relief percentage.</li>
        <li>Check your relevant earnings against the Revenue cap.</li>
        <li>Multiply your eligible earnings by the age-related percentage to find the maximum relievable contribution.</li>
        <li>Reduce your taxable income by the relievable amount when estimating PAYE liability.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <p><strong>Can I carry forward unused relief?</strong> PRSA/Personal pension relief is generally claimed for the year of payment; verify carry-forward rules with your provider or advisor.</p>
        <p><strong>Does AVC relief differ?</strong> Additional voluntary contributions usually follow the same age-related limits, subject to your overall cap.</p>
        <p><strong>How does this affect PRSI or USC?</strong> Pension relief reduces taxable income for PAYE, but PRSI and USC bases may differ.</p>
