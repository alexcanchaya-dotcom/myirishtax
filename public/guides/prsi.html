      <h1>PRSI rates and classes</h1>
      <p>PRSI applies differently depending on whether you are an employee (Class A) or self-employed (Class S). Use this guide to map the 4% default in the calculator to your situation.</p>

      <h2 id="prsi-rates">Key reminders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Most Class A employees pay 4% PRSI on reckonable earnings.</li>
        <li>Class S (self-employed) also pay 4% plus potential surcharges and minimum charges.</li>
        <li>Weekly credits can reduce the effective rate for lower income; these credits are not simulated in the calculator.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="prsi-how">How to check your PRSI</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify your class from your payslip or Revenue correspondence.</li>
        <li>Confirm if any PRSI-free weeks or credits apply for low earnings.</li>
        <li>Apply 4% to your annual reckonable income for a quick estimate, then adjust for credits as needed.</li>
        <li>Enter your income in the calculator with PRSI toggled on to see the baseline deduction.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <p><strong>Do pension contributions reduce PRSI?</strong> No, PRSI is based on gross reckonable income before pension relief.</p>
        <p><strong>Are share-based awards subject to PRSI?</strong> Often yes for employees; check the award type and timing.</p>
        <p><strong>What about directors?</strong> Proprietary directors may fall under different classes; confirm with Revenue or payroll.</p>
