      <h1>Rental income expenses</h1>
      <p>Landlords can deduct certain expenses to reduce taxable rental profits. This guide summarises common deductions and how to document them.</p>

      <h2 id="rental-allowable">Allowable expenses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mortgage interest (subject to Revenue rules) and approved RAS/RTB registrations.</li>
        <li>Repairs and maintenance (not capital improvements).</li>
        <li>Insurance, management fees, accountancy fees, and letting costs.</li>
        <li>Wear and tear allowances where applicable for furnishings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="rental-how">How to apply expenses</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Keep invoices and receipts that show the date, supplier, and description.</li>
        <li>Separate capital improvements from repairs; capital items may be relieved differently.</li>
        <li>Deduct allowable expenses from gross rent to find taxable rental profits.</li>
        <li>Include rental profits in your income tax, USC, and PRSI calculations.</li>
      </ol>
