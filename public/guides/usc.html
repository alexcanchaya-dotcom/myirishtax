      <h1>USC rates and thresholds</h1>
      <p>Use this guide to understand how Universal Social Charge (USC) bands apply and how to map your inputs to the calculator.</p>

      <h2 id="usc-bands">Current illustrative bands</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>0.5% on income up to €12,012</li>
        <li>2% on €12,013 – €25,460</li>
        <li>4.5% on €25,461 – €55,216</li>
        <li>8% on remaining income (surcharge may apply to certain self-employed income)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="meta">Always confirm thresholds with Revenue for the relevant tax year.</p>

      <h2 id="usc-how">How to apply USC</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Check if your income is below the USC exemption threshold for the year.</li>
        <li>Apply each band progressively to your gross income.</li>
        <li>Add any applicable surcharge for non-PAYE/self-employed income above the Revenue limit.</li>
        <li>Input your total income in the calculator and leave USC toggled on to see the estimate.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <p><strong>Do social welfare payments attract USC?</strong> Most social welfare payments are exempt, but taxable benefits may still be included—confirm with Revenue guidance.</p>
        <p><strong>What if my income changes mid-year?</strong> USC is cumulative; payroll will adjust across the year. The calculator provides a simplified annual view.</p>
        <p><strong>Are medical card holders treated differently?</strong> Reduced rates can apply; this lightweight guide does not model that relief.</p>
