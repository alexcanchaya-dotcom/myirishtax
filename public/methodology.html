      <h1>How calculations work</h1>
      <p>Our calculator is designed for speed and clarity. It provides a guide, not advice, and should be paired with <a href="/disclaimer.html">our non-advice disclaimer</a>. Thresholds and credits are updated for the latest tax year noted on the homepage.</p>

      <h2>PAYE logic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Applies 20% to income up to the standard rate cut-off you enter, then 40% thereafter.</li>
        <li>Subtracts the tax credits you provide; defaults use common personal plus PAYE credits for single filers.</li>
        <li>Does not currently include age, home carer, or rent credits unless you add them to the credits input.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>USC logic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses progressive bands: 0.5%, 2%, 4.5%, then 8% on the remainder unless you toggle USC off.</li>
        <li>Exemption checks for very low income are not applied; confirm eligibility before filing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PRSI logic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculates 4% Class A by default. Self-employed Class S users should validate surcharges separately.</li>
        <li>Credits for low earnings and part-year exemptions are not simulated in this lightweight tool.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rounding and timing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Outputs are rounded to two decimals for readability; Revenue calculations may round differently.</li>
        <li>Assumes a full tax year with consistent income; mid-year changes and cumulative bases are out of scope.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to do next</h2>
      <p>Review the methodology before quoting figures in ads or client proposals. Use the <a href="/data-sources.html">data sources</a> page to confirm each rate, and consult our explainers for <a href="/guides/usc.html">USC</a>, <a href="/guides/prsi.html">PRSI</a>, <a href="/guides/pension-tax-relief.html">pension relief</a>, <a href="/guides/bik.html">BIK</a>, and <a href="/guides/rental-expenses.html">rental expenses</a>.</p>
