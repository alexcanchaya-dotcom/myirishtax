      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective: February 2025</p>
      <p>My Irish Tax (“we”) provides an online calculator, explainers, and support options. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal data in line with GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.</p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact information (name, email, phone) submitted via forms or support channels.</li>
        <li>Service context (selected service type, questions asked) so we can respond accurately.</li>
        <li>Tax and employment documents you upload when you explicitly opt in to onboarding.</li>
        <li>Usage and analytics data collected only when you consent via the cookie banner.</li>
        <li>Consent logs stored locally in your browser showing the timestamp and categories you chose.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide calculators, reminders, onboarding, and advisory services you request.</li>
        <li>Send onboarding or reminder emails when you opt in and allow us to contact you.</li>
        <li>Improve our website and guard against abuse or fraud.</li>
        <li>Meet legal and tax obligations, including anti-money-laundering checks when engaged.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legal bases</h2>
      <p>Performance of a contract or steps prior to entering one; legitimate interests (service improvement and security); compliance with legal obligations; and consent for analytics, marketing, or optional performance monitoring.</p>

      <h2>Data sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell data. We may share data with processors such as email delivery, secure file storage, or analytics providers bound by confidentiality and GDPR-compliant agreements. Where services are outside the EEA, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent safeguards.</p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>Contact enquiries are retained for up to 24 months; onboarding and engagement records follow statutory tax/audit timelines; consent logs stay in your browser until you delete them. You may request deletion where applicable.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>Data is encrypted in transit. Infrastructure is designed to support encrypted storage (e.g., SSE for document storage), role-based access, and least-privilege service accounts.</p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>You may request access, correction, deletion, restriction, or portability. You may also object to processing based on legitimate interests. Contact <a href="mailto:privacy@myirishtax.com">privacy@myirishtax.com</a> to exercise rights.</p>

      <h2>Cookies and consent</h2>
      <p>We use essential cookies plus optional analytics and performance monitoring. Manage preferences via the banner on our site, the “Cookie settings” button, or visit the <a href="/cookies.html">Cookie Notice</a> for details on categories and providers.</p>
